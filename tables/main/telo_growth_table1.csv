*The unit for relative telomere length is the T/S ratio. Telomere length was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR), a method that determines relative telomere length by measuring the factor by which each DNA sample differs from a reference DNA sample in its ratio of telomere repeat copy number (T) to single-copy gene copy number (S)
